            <h1>Bose - a white noise cancelling headphones</h1>
            <h2>What UI elements did I see and/or interact with while finding,  comparing, selecting, and configuring the specific product?</h2>
            <p>The navigation bar, the dropdown menu, the comparison feature, the color options, the buy button, the reviews, the buy now button.</p>
            <h2>Have I seen this UI element before in other contexts?</h2>
            <p>I have seen most of them except the comparison feature which I think is interesting because it allows the user to choose what products you want to compare instead of listing everything on the page.</p>
            <h2>Did I know what this element would do before I interacted with it? Why?
            </h2>
            <p>Yes, because the elements are straightforward: using text instead of icons.
            </p>
            <h2>What general problem is this element designed to handle?</h2>
            <p>The comparison feature is designed because there are a lot of similar products within the noise cancelling category and it makes sense to design an element like this for users to compare easily.</p>
            <h2>Why was it used in this context? Is it successful?
            </h2>
            <p>It is used because users probably don't have the patience to go through every page by themselves, so I think this function is successful in terms of helping users save time.
            </p>

            <h1>Macy's - a blue casual shirt
            </h1>
            <h2>What UI elements did I see and/or interact with while finding,  comparing, selecting, and configuring the specific product?</h2>
            <p>The navigation bar, the dropdown menu, a filter of different category of shirts, a filter feature on the left with other options such as color, a “more like this” dropdown to compare similar shirts, options for color and size(ui including “size chart” and “what size fit me”), an add to bag button
            </p>
            <h2>Have I seen this UI element before in other contexts?</h2>
            <p>The filter: I’ve seen it elsewhere but here the designer separates the filter for different types of shirt(casual, t-shirt, dress, polo) and the filter for other options such as sales/brand/size/color/price, etc. 
            </p>
            <h2>Did I know what this element would do before I interacted with it? Why?
            </h2>
            <p>I did because they have checkboxes and round buttons that look clickable.
            </p>
            <h2>What general problem is this element designed to handle?</h2>
            <p>To handle the problem that there are many different categories of shirts as well as other characteristics.
            </p>
            <h2>Why was it used in this context? Is it successful?
            </h2>
            <p>To help users categorize and find the shirt that they are looking for.

            <h1>Sephora - Face sunscreen for oily skin type
            </h1>
            <h2>What UI elements did I see and/or interact with while finding,  comparing, selecting, and configuring the specific product?</h2>
            <p>Nav bar, dropdown menu, filter, a quicklook option, size option, ship/pickup option, add to basket button

            </p>
            <h2>Have I seen this UI element before in other contexts?</h2>
            <p>I don’t remember seeing the quicklook option but it looks familiar because it essentially summarizes what the product is and what are the available buying options so that users don’t need to navigate to another page.
            </p>
            <h2>Did I know what this element would do before I interacted with it? Why?
            </h2>
            <p>Yes because when hover the text “quicklook” appears.

            </p>
            <h2>What general problem is this element designed to handle?</h2>
            <p>The problem of navigating back and forth on different pages.

            </p>
            <h2>Why was it used in this context? Is it successful?
            </h2>
            <p>It is used because there are a variety of options for sunscreen and it is useful to learn their buying options without navigating to another page.

            <h1>Tiffany & Co. - rose gold necklace
            </h1>
            <h2>What UI elements did I see and/or interact with while finding,  comparing, selecting, and configuring the specific product?</h2>
            <p>Nav bar, dropdown menu, filter option, sort by option, when hover price and add to bag appears, an option to choose quantity

            </p>
            <h2>Have I seen this UI element before in other contexts?</h2>
            <p>Yes, I have seen the elements

            </p>
            <h2>Did I know what this element would do before I interacted with it? Why?
            </h2>
            <p>I had some confusion to choose between Necklaces & Pendants / Rose Gold Jewelry. And I clicked on the second option first but I couldn’t sort by category.
            </p>
            <h2>What general problem is this element designed to handle?</h2>
            <p>For users to quickly sort by different preferences.

            </p>
            <h2>Why was it used in this context? Is it successful?
            </h2>
            <p>Because jewelry has different materials, but it is not so successful in terms of the filter option.

            <h1>Summary
            </h1>
            <h2>What elements or patterns seem universal?</h2>
            <p>Navigation bar, dropdown menu, filter option, different categories(color, size)

            </p>
            <h2>Did I see anything that felt different or unusual?</h2>
            <p>Yes, it felt unusual and unnecessary to have “shop by category”, “shop by Metal”, and “shop by Gemstone” option on the dropdown menu when some of those options could be combined or made as filters.


            </p>
            <h2>What elements or patterns were specific to the store or product?

            </h2>
            <p>Some compare elements as well as the filters are specific to different stores.

            </p>
            <h2>Were there any patterns or techniques that made one store stand out? Could the other stores have applied that technique successfully?
            </h2>
            <p>The filter option for Macy’s and the comparison feature for Bose. I think other stores could also have a more detailed but straightforward filter like Macy’s when there are lots of products. 


            </p>
            <h2>Finally, how did you feel when interacting with these sites? When were you happiest/most comfortable? When were you disrupted/confused/bothered?

            </h2>
            <p>I was most comfortable with the filter for Macy’s because it has many different options for me. I felt confused when I wanted to look for a rose gold necklace but there are both a “necklace” category and a “rose gold” category.
