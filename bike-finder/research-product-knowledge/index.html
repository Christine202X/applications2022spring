                I used these websites to investigate what bikes they sell and what variations there are. I also learned about people who use bikes, such as athletes, students, kids, etc. Some of the things people seem to consider are the price, the size, the appearance, and where they intend to use the bikes.

            <p>A buyer will definitely face the question of how to choose a suitable bike that could be used for their intended purposes, so I think it is important to help them analyze and choose the perfect bike using methods such as a filter system or a short questionnaire(like the bike finder system on <a href="https://www.bikesonline.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAxoiQBhCRARIsAPsvo-xwaIuygSn9MO1Y-CpaTN7ev1o_o7Ez7R86_xJopOj_RqCGFsCptGwaAmJOEALw_wcB">Bikesonline</a>). It is also important to think of the priorities of different people. Some of them might be more concerned with how cost-effective the bike is, so there could be a comparison system to help them compare the price and quality of similar bikes. Some people might be more drawn to the aesthetic qualities, so there could be a filter for color, style, etc. Some of the things I didn’t understand at first include differences between a mountain bike and a gravel bike, and I learned that gravel bikes offer comfort and stability at a higher speed on smoother roads, and mountain bikes provide more control in off-road terrain.
